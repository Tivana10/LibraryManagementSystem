This project is a simple Library Management System developed using Java and JDBC with a MySQL database. The system allows librarians to add and view books, register users, and manage book borrowing and returning through recorded transactions. It ensures that books can only be borrowed when available and updates their status automatically.

The application was created as a learning project to demonstrate Java database integration using JDBC. It focuses on core programming concepts such as SQL queries, prepared statements, and console-based user interaction, making it suitable for beginners studying Java and database systems
